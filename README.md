&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Framework for authoring agentic flows on the JVM that seamlessly mix LLM-prompted interactions
with code and domain models. Supports
intelligent path finding towards goals. Written in Kotlin
but offers a natural usage
model from Java.
From the creator of Spring.

## Key Concepts

Models agentic flows in terms of:

- **Actions**: Steps an agent takes
- **Goals**: What the agent is trying to achieve
- **Conditions**: Conditions to assess before executing an action or determining that a goal has been achieved.
  Conditions are reassessed after each action is executed.
- **Domain model**: Objects underpinning the flow and informing Actions, Goals and Conditions.
- **Plan**: A sequence of actions to achieve a goal. Plans are dynamically formulated by the system, not the programmer.
  The
  system replans after the completion of each action, allowing it to adapt to new information as well as observe the
  effects of the previous action.
  This is effectively an [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop).

> Application developers don't usually have to deal with these concepts directly,
> as most conditions result from data flow defined in code, allowing the system to infer
> pre and post conditions.

These concepts deliver the following differentiators versus other agentic systems:

- **Sophisticated planning.** Goes beyond a finite state machine or sequential execution
  with nesting by introducing a true planning step, using a
  non-LLM AI algorithm. This enables the system to perform tasks it wasn’t programmed to do by combining known
  steps in
  a novel order, as well as make decisions about parallelization and other runtime behavior.
- **Superior extensibility and reuse**: Because of dynamic planning, adding more domain objects, actions, goals and
  conditions
  can extend the capability of the system, _without editing FSM definitions._
- **Strong typing and the benefits of object orientation**: Actions, goals and conditions are informed by a domain
  model, which can
  include behavior. Everything is strongly typed and prompts and
  manually authored code interact cleanly. No more magic maps. Enjoy full refactoring support.

Other benefits:

- **Platform abstraction**: Clean separation between programming model and platform concept allow running locally while
  potentially offering higher QoS changing application code.
- **Designed for LLM mixing**: It is easy to build applications that mix LLMs, ensuring the most cost effective yet
  capable solution.
  models. This enables the system to leverage the strengths of different models for different tasks.
- **Built on Spring and the JVM,** making it easy to access existing enterprise functionality and capabilities.
  For example:
    - Spring can inject and manage agents, including using Spring AOP to decorate functions.
    - Robust persistence and transaction management solutions are available.
- **Designed for testability** from the ground up. Both unit testing and agent end to end testing are easy.

Flows can be authored in one of two ways:

- Annotation-based model similar to Spring MVC, with types annotated with `@Agent` with `@Goal`, `@Condition` and
  `@Action` methods.
- Kotlin DSL.

Either way, flows are backed by a domain model of objects that can defined behavior.

> We are working toward allowing natural language actions and goals to be deployed.

The planning step is pluggable.

The default planning approach is
GOAP: [Goal Oriented Action Planning](https://medium.com/@vedantchaudhari/goal-oriented-action-planning-34035ed40d0b).
GOAP is a popular AI planning algorithm used in gaming. It allows for dynamic decision-making and action selection based
on the current state of the world and the goals of the agent.

Goals, actions and plans are independent of GOAP. Future planning options include:

- Plans created by a reasoning model such as OpenAI o1 or DeepSeek R1.

The framework executes via `AgentPlatform` implementation.

An agent platform supports the following modes of execution:

- **Focused**, where user code requests particular functionality: User code calls a method to run a particular agent,
  passing in input.
- **Closed**, where user intent is classified to choose an agent: The user expresses an intent and the platform tries to
  find a
  suitable agent among all the agent it knows about. It will run the agent.
  Thus agent choice is dynamic, but only the actions within the particular agent
  can be run.
- **Open**, where the user's goal is determined and the platform uses all its resources to try to achieve it: The user
  expresses an intent and the platform tries to find a
  suitable goal among all the goals it knows about.

Open mode is the most powerful, but least deterministic.
> In open mode, the platform is capable of finding novel paths that were not envisioned by developers, and even
> combining functionality from multiple providers.

Even in open mode, the platform will only perform individual steps
that have been specified. (Of course, steps may themselves be LLM
transforms, in which case the prompts are controlled by user code but the
results are still non-deterministic.)

A further mode is planned in future:

- **Evolving** mode: Where the platform can work with multiple goals in the same process and modify a running process to
  add further goals and agents.
  For example, an action can realize that it has become important to achieve additional goals.

## Show Me The Code

```kotlin
@Agent(description = "Find news based on a person's star sign")
class StarNewsFinder(
    // Services such as Horoscope are injected using Spring
    private val horoscopeService: HoroscopeService,
    private val storyCount: Int = 5,
) {

    @Action
    fun extractPerson(userInput: UserInput): StarPerson =
        // All prompts are typesafe
        PromptRunner().createObject("Create a person from this user input, extracting their name and star sign: $userInput")

    @Action
    fun retrieveHoroscope(starPerson: StarPerson) =
        Horoscope(horoscopeService.dailyHoroscope(starPerson.sign))

    // toolGroups specifies tools that are required for this action to run
    @Action(toolGroups = [ToolGroup.WEB])
    fun findNewsStories(person: StarPerson, horoscope: Horoscope): RelevantNewsStories =
        PromptRunner().createObject(
            """
            ${person.name} is an astrology believer with the sign ${person.sign}.
            Their horoscope for today is:
                <horoscope>${horoscope.summary}</horoscope>
            Given this, use web tools and generate search queries
            to find $storyCount relevant news stories summarize them in a few sentences.
            Include the URL for each story.
            Do not look for another horoscope reading or return results directly about astrology;
            find stories relevant to the reading above.

            For example:
            - If the horoscope says that they may
            want to work on relationships, you could find news stories about
            novel gifts
            - If the horoscope says that they may want to work on their career,
            find news stories about training courses.
        """.trimIndent()
        )

    // The @AchievesGoal annotation indicates that completing this action
    // achieves the given goal, so the agent can be complete
    @AchievesGoal(
        description = "Write an amusing writeup for the target person based on their horoscope and current news stories",
    )
    @Action
    fun writeup(
        person: StarPerson,
        relevantNewsStories: RelevantNewsStories,
        horoscope: Horoscope,
    ): Writeup =
        // Customize LLM call
        PromptRunner().withTemperature(1.2).createObject(
            """
            Take the following news stories and write up something
            amusing for the target person.

            Begin by summarizing their horoscope in a concise, amusing way, then
            talk about the news. End with a surprising signoff.

            ${person.name} is an astrology believer with the sign ${person.sign}.
            Their horoscope for today is:
                <horoscope>${horoscope.summary}</horoscope>
            Relevant news stories are:
            ${relevantNewsStories.items.joinToString("\n") { "- ${it.url}: ${it.summary}" }}

            Format it as Markdown with links.
        """.trimIndent()
        )

}
```

The following domain classes ensure type safety:

```kotlin
data class RelevantNewsStories(
    val items: List<NewsStory>
)

data class NewsStory(
    val url: String,

    val summary: String,
)

data class Subject(
    val name: String,
    val sign: String,
)

data class Horoscope(
    val summary: String,
)

data class FunnyWriteup(
    override val text: String,
) : HasContent
```

## Dog Food Policy

We believe that all aspects of software development can
be greatly accelerated through the use of AI agents. The ultimate decision
makers remain human, but they can and should be greatly augmented.

> This project practices extreme dogfooding.

<!-- TODO photo of Duke with kibble -->

Our key principles:

1. **We will use AI agents to help every aspect of the project:** coding, documentation, producing marketing copy etc.
   Any
   human performing a task should ask why it cannot be automated, and strive toward maximum automation.
2. **Developers retain ultimate control.** Developers are responsible for guiding agents toward the solution and
   iterating
   as necessary. A developer who commits or merges an agent contribution
   is responsible for ensuring that it meets the project coding standards, which are
   independent of the use of agents. For example, code must be human readable.
3. **We will use only open source agents built on the Embabel platform,** and contribute any improvements. While
   commercial coding agents
   may be more advanced, we believe that our
   platform is the best general solution for automation and by dogfooding we will improve it fastest.
   By open sourcing agents used on our open source projects, we will maximize benefit to the community.
4. **We will prioritize agents that help accelerate our progress.** Per the flight safety advice to fit your own mask
   before helping others, we will prioritize
   agents that help us accelerate our own progress. This will not only produce useful examples, but increase overall
   project velocity.

Developers must carefully read all code they commit and improve generated code if possible.

## Getting Started

- Get the bits
- Set up your environment
- Set up Maven Settings with GitHub Token
- Run the application

### Getting the bits

Choose one of the following:

- Clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent`
- Create a new Spring Boot project and add the necessary dependencies (TODO)

### Environment variables

> Environment variables are consistent with common usage, rather than Spring AI.
> For example, we prefer `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `SPRING_AI_OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Required:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For the OpenAI API

Optional:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: For the Anthropic API. Necessary for the coding agent.

You will also need Docker Desktop with the Docker MCP extension installed for
Docker MCP tools such as web search tools. Be sure to activate
the following tools from the catalog:

- Brave Search
- Fetch
- Puppeteer
- Wikipedia

### Running

The easiest way to run the application using using one of the scripts in the
`scripts` directory. You can start the shell in interactive mode with:

```bash
cd scripts
./shell.sh
````

This script will also warn of any missing environment variables.

You can also run the shell under your IDE or from the command line
using Maven directly:

```bash
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=shell,starwars
mvn spring-boot:run
```

> The export is separate from the mvn command to avoid Spring Shell trying to process the profiles as a command.

Type `help` to see the available commands.

An example:

```
execute "Lynda is a Scorpio, find news for her" -p -r
```

This will look for a goal, find the star finder goal and
run the flow. `-p` will log prompts `-r` will log LLM responses.
Omit these for less verbose logging.

Use the `chat` command to enter an interactive chat with the agent.
It will retain conversation history and attempt to run the most appropriate
agent for each command.

> Spring Shell supports history. Type `!!` to repeat the last command.
> This will survive restarts, so is handy when iterating on an agent.

#### Further examples

Example commands within the shell:

```
execute "explain this project for a five your old"

execute "take the StarNewsFinder kotlin example of the agent framework. create a parallel .java package beside its and create a java version of the same agent use the same annotations and other classes. use records for the data classes. make it modern java"

execute "consider the StarNewsFinder kotlin class. This is intended as an example. Is there anything you could do to make it simpler? Include suggested API changes. Do not change code"
```

### Bringing in additional LLMs

#### Local models with well-known providers

The Embabel Agent Framework supports local models from:

- Ollama: Simply set the `ollama` profile and your local Ollama endpoint will be queries. All local models will be
  available.
- Docker: Set the `docker` profile and your local Docker endpoint will be queried. All local models will be available.

#### Custom LLMs

You can define an LLM for any provider for which a Spring AI `ChatModel` is available.

Simply define Spring beans of type `Llm`.
See the `OpenAiConfiguration` class as an example.

Remember:

- Provide the knowledge cutoff date if you know it
- Make the configuration class conditional on any required API key.

## Roadmap

This project is in its early stages, but we have big plans.
The milestones and issues in this repository are a good reference.
Our key goals:

- **Become the natural way to Gen AI-enable Java applications**, and especially those built on Spring.
- **Prove the power of the model**. Demonstrate that this model is the most capable agent
  model. See the [Dunnart milestone](https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent/milestone/4) for details.
  In particular:
    - Demonstrate the power of extensibility without modification, by adding goals and actions
    - Demonstrate the potential to become the PaaS for natural language
    - Demonstrate the potential of agent federation within the GOAP model
    - Demonstrate budget-aware agents, such as "Research the following topic, spending up to 20c if you are still
      learning"
    - Integrate with data stores and demonstrate the power of surfacing existing functionality inside an organization
- **Take the model to other platforms**: The conceptual framework is not JVM specific. Once established, we intend to
  create TypeScript
  and Python projects.

There is a lot to do, and you are awesome. We look forward to your contribution!

## Application Design

### Domain objects

Applications center around domain objects. These can be created by LLMs or user
code and manipulated by user code.

Use Jackson annotations to help LLMs with descriptions as well as mark fields to ignore.
For example:

```kotlin
@JsonClassDescription("Person with astrology details")
data class StarPerson(
    override val name: String,
    @get:JsonPropertyDescription("Star sign")
    val sign: String,
) : Person
```

See [Java Json Schema Generation - Module Jackson](https://github.com/victools/jsonschema-generator/tree/main/jsonschema-module-jackson)
for documentation of the library used.

## Using as an MCP server

You can use the Embabel agent platform as an MCP server from a
UI like Claude Desktop.

Because Claude only presently works over stdio, and we rightly ignore stdio in favor of SSE, you will need
to use a [layer in between](https://makhlevich.substack.com/p/converting-an-mcp-server-from-sse).

## Consuming MCP Servers

The Embabel Agent Framework provides built-in support for consuming Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, allowing you
to extend your applications with powerful AI capabilities through standardized interfaces.

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context and extra
functionality to large language models. Introduced by Anthropic, MCP has emerged as the de facto standard for connecting
AI agents to tools, functioning as a client-server protocol where:

- **Clients** (like Embabel Agent) send requests to servers
- **Servers** process those requests to deliver necessary context to the AI model

MCP simplifies integration between AI applications and external tools, transforming an "M×N problem" into an "M+N
problem" through standardization - similar to what USB did for hardware peripherals.

### Configuring MCP in Embabel Agent

To configure MCP servers in your Embabel Agent application, add the following to your `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  ai:
    mcp:
      client:
        enabled: true
        name: embabel
        version: 1.0.0
        request-timeout: 30s
        type: SYNC
        stdio:
          connections:
            docker-mcp:
              command: docker
              args:
                - run
                - -i
                - --rm
                - alpine/socat
                - STDIO
                - TCP:host.docker.internal:8811
```

This configuration sets up an MCP client that connects to a Docker-based MCP server. The connection uses STDIO transport
through Docker's socat utility to connect to a TCP endpoint.

### Docker Desktop MCP Integration

Docker has embraced MCP with their Docker MCP Catalog and Toolkit, which provides:

1. **Centralized Discovery** - A trusted hub for discovering MCP tools integrated into Docker Hub
2. **Containerized Deployment** - Run MCP servers as containers without complex setup
3. **Secure Credential Management** - Centralized, encrypted credential handling
4. **Built-in Security** - Sandbox isolation and permissions management

The Docker MCP ecosystem includes over 100 verified tools from partners like Stripe, Elastic, Neo4j, and more, all
accessible through Docker's infrastructure.

## Running Tests

Run the tests via Maven.

```bash
mvn test
```

This will run both unit and integration tests
but will not require an internet connection or any external services.

## Spring profiles

Spring profiles are used to configure the application for different environments and behaviors.

Interaction profiles:

- `shell`: Runs agent in interactive shell. Does not start web process.

Model profiles:

- `ollama`: Looks for Ollama models. You will need to have Ollama installed locally and the relevant models pulled.
- `docker-desktop`: Looks for Docker-managed local models when running outside Docker but talking to Docker Desktop with
  the MCP extension. **This is recommended for the best experience, with Docker-provided web tools.**
- `docker`: Looks for Docker-managed local models when running in a Docker container.

Logging profiles:

- `severance`: [Severance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEQP4VVuyrY&ab_channel=AppleTV) specific logging. Praise
  Kier!
- `starwars`: Star Wars specific logging. Feel the force
- `colossus`: Colossus specific logging. The Forbin Project.

## Testing

A key goal of this framework is ease of testing.
Just as Spring eased testing of early enterprise Java applications,
this framework facilitates testing of AI applications.

Types of testing:

- Unit tests: All agents are unit testable, like any Spring-managed beans. Construct them with mock objects; call
  individual action methods. The testing library facilitates testing prompts.
- Integration tests: tbd

## Logging

All logging in this project is either debug logging in the relevant
class itself, or results from the stream of events of type `AgentEvent`.

Edit `application.yml` if you want to see debug logging from the relevant classes and packages.

Available logging experiences:

- `severance`: Severance logging. Praise Kier
- `starwars`: Star Wars logging. Feel the force. The default as it's understood throughout the galaxy.
- `colossus`: Colossus logging. The Forbin Project.
- `montypython`: Monty Python logging. No one expects it.

If none of these profiles is chosen, vanilla logging will occur. This makes me sad.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Embabel Agent Framework.

This file also informs agentic coding behavior.

## Miscellaneous

- _Why the name Embabel?_
  The "babel" part is inspired by the story of the Tower of Babel. Embabel is intended to bring many languages to
  applications.
  "embabel" also sounds like "enable."
- Milestone names are Australian animals. Mythical animals such as "bunyip" and "yowie" are used for futures that may or
  not be implemented.
- README badges come from [here](https://github.com/Ileriayo/markdown-badges).
