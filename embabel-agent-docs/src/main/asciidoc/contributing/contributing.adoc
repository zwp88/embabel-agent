Open source is a wonderful thing.
We welcome contributions to the Embabel project.

How to contribute:

- Familiarize yourself with the project by reading the documentation.
- Familiarize yourself with the https://github.com/embabel/embabel-agent/issues/[issue tracker] and open pull requests to ensure you're not duplicating something.
- https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits[Sign your commits]
- Always include a description with your pull requests. *PRs without descriptions will be closed.*
- Join the Embabel community on Discord at https://discord.gg/t6bjkyj93q.

Contributions are not limited to code.
You can also help by:

- Improving the documentation
- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting new features
- Engaging with the community on Discord
- Creating examples and other materials
- Talking about Embabel at meetups and conferences
- Posting about Embabel on social media

When contributing code, **do** augment your productivity using coding agents and LLMs, but avoid these pitfalls:

- **Excessive LLM comments that add no value**.
Code should be self-documenting.
Comments are for things that are non-obvious.
- **Bloated PR descriptions and other content.**

Nothing personal, but such contributions will automatically be rejected.

IMPORTANT: You must understand anything you contribute.
