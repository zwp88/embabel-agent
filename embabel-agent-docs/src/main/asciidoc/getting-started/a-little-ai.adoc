=== Adding a Little AI to Your Application

Before we get into the magic of full-blown Embabel agents, let's see how easy it is to add a little AI to your application using the Embabel framework.
Sometimes this is all you need.

The simplest way to use Embabel is to inject an `OperationContext` and use its AI capabilities directly.
This approach is consistent with standard Spring dependency injection patterns.

[source,java]
----
package com.embabel.example.injection;

import com.embabel.agent.api.common.OperationContext;
import com.embabel.common.ai.model.LlmOptions;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

/**
 * Demonstrate the simplest use of Embabel's AI capabilities,
 * injecting an AI OperationContext into a Spring component.
 * The jokes will be terrible, but don't blame Embabel, blame the LLM.
 */
@Component
public record InjectedComponent(
        OperationContext operationContext
) {

    public record Joke(String leadup, String punchline) {
    }

    public String tellJokeAbout(String topic) {
        return operationContext.ai()
                .withLlm(LlmOptions.withDefaultLlm().withTemperature(.8))
                .generateText("Tell me a joke about " + topic);
    }

    public Joke createJokeObjectAbout(String topic1, String topic2, String voice) {
        return operationContext.ai()
                .withLlm(LlmOptions.withDefaultLlm().withTemperature(.8))
                .createObject("""
                                Tell me a joke about %s and %s.
                                The voice of the joke should be %s.
                                The joke should have a leadup and a punchline.
                                """.formatted(topic1, topic2, voice),
                        Joke.class);
    }
}

This example demonstrates several key aspects of Embabel's design philosophy:

* **Standard Spring Integration**: The `OperationContext` is injected like any other Spring dependency using constructor injection
* **Simple API**: Access AI capabilities through `operationContext.ai()`
* **Flexible Configuration**: Configure LLM options like temperature on a per-call basis
* **Type Safety**: Generate structured objects directly with `createObject()` method
* **Consistent Patterns**: Works exactly like you'd expect any Spring component to work

The `OperationContext` provides access to all of Embabel's AI capabilities without requiring a full agent setup, making it perfect for adding AI features to existing applications incrementally.

TIP: The `OperationContext` API is used throughout Embabel applications, as a convenient gateway to key AI and other functionality.
