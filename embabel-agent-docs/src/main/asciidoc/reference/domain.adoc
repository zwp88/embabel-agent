=== Domain Objects

Domain objects in Embabel are not just strongly-typed data structures - they are real objects with behavior that can be selectively exposed to LLMs and used in agent actions.

==== Objects with Behavior

Unlike simple structs or DTOs, Embabel domain objects can encapsulate business logic and expose it to LLMs through the `@Tool` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Customer {
    private String name;
    private LoyaltyLevel loyaltyLevel;
    private List<Order> orders;

    @Tool(description = "Calculate the customer's loyalty discount percentage")
    public BigDecimal getLoyaltyDiscount() {
        return loyaltyLevel.calculateDiscount(orders.size());
    }

    @Tool(description = "Check if customer is eligible for premium service")  
    public boolean isPremiumEligible() {
        return orders.stream()
            .mapToDouble(Order::getTotal)
            .sum() > 1000.0;
    }

    // Regular methods not exposed to LLMs
    private void updateLoyaltyLevel() {
        // Internal business logic
    }
}
----

==== Selective Tool Exposure

The `@Tool` annotation allows you to selectively expose domain object methods to LLMs:

- **Business Logic**: Expose methods that provide business value to the LLM
- **Calculated Properties**: Methods that compute derived values
- **Business Rules**: Methods that implement domain-specific rules
- **Keep Private**: Internal implementation details remain hidden

==== Use in Actions

Domain objects can be used naturally in action methods, combining LLM interactions with traditional object-oriented programming:

[source,java]
----
@Action
public Recommendation generateRecommendation(Customer customer, OperationContext context) {
    // LLM has access to customer.getLoyaltyDiscount() and customer.isPremiumEligible()
    // as tools, plus the customer object structure
    
    String prompt = String.format(
        "Generate a personalized recommendation for %s based on their profile",
        customer.getName()
    );
    
    return context.ai()
        .withDefaultLlm()
        .createObject(prompt, Recommendation.class);
}
----

==== Domain Understanding is Critical

As outlined in Rod Johnson's blog introducing DICE (Domain-Integrated Context Engineering) in https://medium.com/@springrod/context-engineering-needs-domain-understanding-b4387e8e4bf8[Context Engineering Needs Domain Understanding], domain understanding is fundamental to effective context engineering.
Domain objects serve as the bridge between:

- **Business Domain**: Real-world entities and their relationships
- **Agent Behavior**: How LLMs understand and interact with the domain
- **Code Actions**: Traditional programming logic that operates on domain objects

==== Benefits

- **Rich Context**: LLMs receive both data structure and behavioral context
- **Encapsulation**: Business logic stays within domain objects where it belongs
- **Reusability**: Domain objects can be used across multiple agents
- **Testability**: Domain logic can be unit tested independently
- **Evolution**: Adding new tools to domain objects extends agent capabilities

This approach ensures that agents work with meaningful business entities rather than generic data structures, leading to more natural and effective AI interactions.
