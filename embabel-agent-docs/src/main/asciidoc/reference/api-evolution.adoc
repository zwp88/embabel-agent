=== API Evolution

While Embabel is still pre-GA, we strive to avoid breaking changes.

Because Embabel builds on Spring's POJO support, framework code dependencies are localized and minimized.

The key surface area is the `Ai` and `PromptRunner` interfaces, which we will strive to avoid breaking.

For maximum stability:

- Always use the latest stable version rather than a snapshot.
Snapshots may change frequently.
- Avoid using types under the `com.embabel.agent.experimental` package.
- Avoid using any method or class marked with the `@ApiStatus.Experimental` or `@ApiStatus.Internal` annotations.

IMPORTANT: application code should not depend on any types under the `com.embabel.agent.spi` package.
This is intended for provision of runtime infrastructure only, and may change without notice.
