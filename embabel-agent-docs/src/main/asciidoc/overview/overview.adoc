Agentic AI is the use of large language (and other multi-modal) models not just to generate text, but to act as
reasoning, goal-driven agents that can plan, call tools, and adapt their actions to deliver outcomes.

The JVM is a compelling platform for this because its strong type safety provides guardrails for integrating LLM-driven
behaviors with real systems. Because so many production applications already run on the JVM it is the natural place to
embed AI.

While Agentic AI has been hyped, much of it has lived in academic demos with little practical value; by integrating
directly into legacy and enterprise JVM applications, we can unlock AI capabilities without rewriting core systems or
tearing down a factory to install new machinery.
