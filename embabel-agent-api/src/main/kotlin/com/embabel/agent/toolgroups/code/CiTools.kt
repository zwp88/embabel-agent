/**
 * Interface for Continuous Integration tools that enable building and testing projects.
 *
 * The CiTools interface provides functionality for executing build commands within a project's
 * root directory. It serves as a bridge between the agent and the underlying build system,
 * allowing for seamless integration with various build tools like Maven, Gradle, npm, etc.
 *
 * This interface extends:
 * - [SelfToolCallbackPublisher]: Automatically publishes methods annotated with @Tool to be
 *   available as callable tools by the agent system. This enables the methods to be discovered
 *   and invoked through the tool callback mechanism.
 * - [DirectoryBased]: Provides access to the root directory on the host machine where the
 *   project is located. This allows build commands to be executed in the correct context.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface are expected to handle the execution of build commands
 * and process their output appropriately.
