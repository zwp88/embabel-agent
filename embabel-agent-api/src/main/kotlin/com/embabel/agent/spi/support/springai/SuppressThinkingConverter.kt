/**
 * A decorator for Spring AI's [StructuredOutputConverter] that cleans up LLM outputs by removing "thinking" blocks.
 *
 * Spring AI's [StructuredOutputConverter] is designed to parse structured formats (like JSON) from
 * LLM outputs, but it can fail if the output contains additional text like reasoning blocks.
 * For example, if an LLM returns:
 *
 * ```
 * <think>
 * Let me think about what information to include in this person object.
 * The name should be "John Doe" and the age should be 30.
 * </think>
 * {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
 * ```
 *
 * A standard converter would fail to parse this as valid JSON.
 *
 * This decorator sanitizes the input by removing any content enclosed in <think> tags before
 * passing it to the delegate converter, allowing reasoning models to be used with Spring AI's
 * structured output functionality.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * Wrap any existing [StructuredOutputConverter] with this class:
 * ```
 * val originalConverter = BeanOutputConverter(Person::class.java)
 * val thinkingAwareConverter = SuppressThinkingConverter(originalConverter)
 * ```
 *
 * @param T The target type that the delegate converter produces
